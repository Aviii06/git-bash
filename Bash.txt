Level 0 : 

“cat readme” worked. 


Level 1 : boJ9jbbUNNfktd78OOpsqOltutMc3MY1

“cat <-” worked. To open files with special symbols in there names like . And - you need to use < and for space you need to use an escape sequence.


Level 2 : CV1DtqXWVFXTvM2F0k09SHz0YwRINYA9

“cat spaces\ in\ this\ filename“ worked.


Level 3: UmHadQclWmgdLOKQ3YNgjWxGoRMb5luK

“cd inhere” and then “cat <.hidden” worked.


Level 4: pIwrPrtPN36QITSp3EQaw936yaFoFgAB

“cd inhere” and then “cat <-file07” worked. Had to try others but the weren’t readable.


Level 5 : koReBOKuIDDepwhWk7jZC0RTdopnAYKh

Du -a -b
-a : shows all files.
-b: tells the block size of the files.
And then finding 1033 byte file(which is in maybe here 7 and hidden file 2)

Level 6 : DXjZPULLxYr17uwoI01bNLQbtFemEgo7

cd .. and cd.. to get to the root folder. Then run find -user bandit7  -group bandit6 then open the only accessible file(./var/lib/dpkg/info/bandit7.password)


Level 7 : HKBPTKQnIay4Fw76bEy8PVxKEDQRKTzs

Cat data.txt and then cmd+f and searched for millionth.
More accurate way would be ‘grep millionth data.txt’


Level 8 : cvX2JJa4CFALtqS87jk27qwqGhBM9plV
cat data.txt | sort | uniq -u(displays only unique elements)
The definition of unique is that the element below the current ins’t the same so we need to sort it too.

Level 9 : UsvVyFSfZZWbi6wgC7dAFyFuR6jQQUhR

strings data.txt | grep =. This will give only few elements and one stands out. That’s the password.

Level 10 : truKLdjsbJ5g7yyJ2X2R0o3a5HQJFuLk

base64 -d data.txt gives : The password is IFukwKGsFW8MOq3IRFqrxE1hxTNEbUPR

Level 11 : IFukwKGsFW8MOq3IRFqrxE1hxTNEbUPR

cat data.txt | tr a-zA-Z n-za-mN-ZA-M.
Tried switch it to ascii but numbers would be maped to special characters which doesn’t make sense hence the logic must only apply to alphabets. The logic must be circular other wise last few of small case alphabets will  be maped to special characters. 

Level 12 : 5Te8Y4drgCRfCx8ugdwuEX8KFC6k2EUu
Go to root then to tmp. From tmp run cat data.txt | xxd -r > data (to store the file to data this also converts hex dump into ascii). This showed error as data.txt is already in that cd into that and then run it again. Now we repeatedly decompress it by storing it into .gz and decompressing using gzip. Initially I repeated the xxd command again and again, It only convert into ascii and doesn’t decompress.

Level 13 : 8ZjyCRiBWFYkneahHwxCv3wb2a1ORpYL

ssh bandit14@localhost -i sshkey.private puts you to bandit14 user and then just cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14

Level 14 : 4wcYUJFw0k0XLShlDzztnTBHiqxU3b3e

We just need to change the local host to do that we can use nc localhost 30000. Put the password in and you’re done.

Level 15 : BfMYroe26WYalil77FoDi9qh59eK5xNr

openssl s_client -connect localhost:30001 -ign_eof
Now paste the password.

Level 16 : cluFn7wTiGryunymYOu4RcffSxQluehd

nmap localhost -p 31000-32000 -A
You’l get that port 31790 is the one where you need to give the password.

Here I was stuck for a while. We need to login to server but just with RSA key(like in level 13). This helped: https://www.linode.com/docs/guides/use-public-key-authentication-with-ssh/

Now we need to store this in a file. But touch doesn’t work. Hence we need to find the place where we have the access to edit.
Go back 2 directories and then go to tmp and then bandit17
touch key then vim key and then just insert the RSA key here.

We also need to restrict what operations the file could have. Googling gives sudo chmod 400 as the easiest solution.

Level 17 :

diff passwords.old passwords.new

< w0Yfolrc5bwjS4qw5mq1nnQi6mF03bii
---
> kfBf3eYk5BPBRzwjqutbbfE887SVc5Yd

This means new one have kfBf3eYk5BPBRzwjqutbbfE887SVc5Yd hence this must be the password.

Level 18 : kfBf3eYk5BPBRzwjqutbbfE887SVc5Yd

ssh bandit18@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220 "cat ~/readme" works.

Level 19 : IueksS7Ubh8G3DCwVzrTd8rAVOwq3M5x

./bandit20-do cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit20. This worked

Level 20 : GbKksEFF4yrVs6il55v6gwY5aVje5f0j
